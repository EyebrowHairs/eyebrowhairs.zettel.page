# New zettel on 2020-06-13

Without knowing the filenames of the other files, it's really hard to create links. Display both filename and title, and have option to quick-copy filename?

Super ideal: create new Zettel by highlight a word in the current Zettel and use the word as file name.

Test link: <0b7b75fb>[^1]

Test image: So you don't have to save the issue when creating the image link, but where is it stored?

[^1]: Test. Nice, this is rendered too (unlike in VS Code or Zettlr)
