Note: this idea is highly influenced by James Clear’s *Atomic Habits*, as I wrote about [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/1000daysofpractice/comments/ehxqqs/a_little_personal_note_on_goals/). To be honest, I haven’t even read the book fully (still working on it slowly but surely…) but I gleaned a lot from the parts I did read!

A little TL;DR on what I summarized:
> Goals help you set a direction, but don't be too focused on reaching them; systems are the steps for how you will accomplish things (what you can focus on and achieve daily); and your underlying beliefs of self-identity will influence your behaviour and thoughts (towards or against what you want to achieve). Also reflect on what you're doing occasionally to make sure you're on the right path and revise your plan accordingly.
> Pick a direction, make a plan, and believe that you are the type of person who will do it!

## What is it?
A place to write down personal project details so you don’t lose sight of the long-term vision and benefits, as well as the many smaller steps that you must take to head in that direction. 

As with most things in this unpredictable world, there are no guarantees that you will reach your goal, but you will be a lot further along the path.

My definition of a ‘project’ seems to be quite broad, more like a lifelong project rather than short temporary ones. ~~There are probably better terms to describe what this actually is.~~ A better way to name it is probably: goals, projects, tasks. [^2]

At its core I believe you need to include your:
1. Long-term vision - what is the ultimate goal you want to achieve? Be grand, but also realistic, and make peace with the fact that you may never actually achieve the goal, but get closer to it.
2. Short-term actions - what small steps should you take to keep walking along this path toward your goal? Constant evaluation and adjusting may be required to ensure you don’t stray too far off the path. You may also realize that you do not even want to walk the path, or run into a fork in the road that takes you on a completely unexpected, but more interesting/rewarding/satisfying path. [^1]

## Implementation
I recently read an article[^2] where the author described how they broke down a major goal into projects, and even smaller tasks. I think it’s generally a good approach since you can adjust any of the components to suit your own goals.

A brief summary:
> The goal responds to the question: «what do you want?», the project responds to the question – «how can I make it?», and the task responds to the question – «what should be done?». [^2]

The projects are split into large (2+ months), medium (2 weeks to 2 months) and small (up to 2 weeks). The goal itself can be split into these various sizes of projects, or larger projects can be split into smaller projects. As expected, larger projects require much more planning and preparation, whereas smaller projects can be started quickly. Tasks are kept to 1-2 weeks, which makes completing them much more manageable. 

Although not mentioned, I believe one can incorporate more daily-type of tasks and habit-building into this plan as well. Instead of thinking about a daily habit as something you will do for all eternity, you can think of it as weekly ‘sprints’. This probably works best for habit-formation, since by the time you formed the habit, you may not need this level of motivation anymore. But if you find yourself slipping, it could be helpful to return to these weekly sprints to stay on track. 

As an example, perhaps you would like to make your bed every morning. Giving yourself a break on Sunday, you would strive to make your bed for the rest of the week. Only 6 days, which sounds more manageable than a bigger goal, like 30 days. At the end of the week, you can do a small reflection. Do you feel like you should continue or stop this habit? Perhaps give it another week before deciding? Hopefully by then the habit has started to solidify more and you decide to continue on, eventually not needing to reflect on it anymore. If you’re still struggling with it, perhaps you decide to give it yet another week, or decide that it’s not something you wanted or needed to do anyways. 

Even a break can be incorporated into weekly sprints. Perhaps you decide to take a break from bed-making to see if that affects you in any way. However, it’s not entirely giving up. At least, until the end of the week. If you still decide to not continue, at least it’s from a conscious decision based on experimentation and reflection, rather than lack of discipline. Or even if it was from lack of discipline, at least I got you to make your bed for 1 or 2 weeks. *wink*
