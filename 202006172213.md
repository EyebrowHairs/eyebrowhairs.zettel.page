## What is it?

### Discovery

I came across the Zettelkasten method back in the spring of 2019. Unfortunately, there weren’t many resources around (although Christian and Sascha over at [https://zettelkasten.de/](https://zettelkasten.de/) have been a huge help!), so I decided to start the subreddit [r/Zettelkasten](https://www.reddit.com/r/Zettelkasten/) to provide a place to gather resources and find like-minded people. 

The activity was slow to non-existent at the start, but fast-forward one year, and you will find that the activity levels have skyrocketed![^1] 

One year ago, I read almost every article I could possibly find on the internet on the Zettelkasten method.

Now, I can hardly keep up with the output!

In order to make sense of all this information, I am currently part of a [team](https://github.com/Kuratoro) maintaining a [public Zettelkasten](https://zk.zettel.page/) on the Zettelkasten method itself. It’s not perfect and progress is slow-going, but it’s a start, and I hope to keep the momentum going for as long as possible.
