A collection of printables that I have created or particularly like.

The main reason why I wanted to print my own paper was so that I could use this special sugar cane paper. It’s relatively thin, but also strong enough to hold fountain pen ink without it bleeding through to the back. For note-taking paper, I usually print the lines so they’re barely visible (it's also ink-saving) and because I want the appearance of a near-blank page with minimal guidelines.
