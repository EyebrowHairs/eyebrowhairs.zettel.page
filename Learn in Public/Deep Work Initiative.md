I'm currently reading Cal Newport's *Deep Work* and decided to apply some concepts to my life. Right now I have very little work-life balance or even differentiation between the two, sometimes working deep into the night to make up for large periods of non-productivity during the day. I've also noticed that I have been building up some tension in my body, so a system that encourages periods of both deep work and deep relaxation will help greatly.

Some concepts to implement:

1) Set up alternating internet and non-internet periods.
	- set up an alarm before starting each period
	- start with 1 hour on/off and work your way up
2) Check email every 2 hours.
	- set up a timer after every check
3) A work-shutdown routine around 8-9pm.
	- review what is left to do, make plans for their completion or migrate them forward to the next day to review.
4) Keep a scoreboard of deep work hours.
	- print a weekly tracker
5) Limit my areas of focus.
	- write them down and pin them up so they're visible
6) Review progress once a week.
	- look at what's been done and if any changes should be made
