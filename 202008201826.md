Note: this idea is highly influenced by James Clear’s *Atomic Habits*, as I wrote about [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/1000daysofpractice/comments/ehxqqs/a_little_personal_note_on_goals/). To be honest, I haven’t even read the book fully (still working on it slowly but surely…) but I gleaned a lot from the parts I did read!

A little TL;DR on what I summarized:
> Goals help you set a direction, but don't be too focused on reaching them; systems are the steps for how you will accomplish things (what you can focus on and achieve daily); and your underlying beliefs of self-identity will influence your behaviour and thoughts (towards or against what you want to achieve). Also reflect on what you're doing occasionally to make sure you're on the right path and revise your plan accordingly.
> Pick a direction, make a plan, and believe that you are the type of person who will do it!

## What is it?
A place to write down personal project details so you don’t lose sight of the long-term vision and benefits, as well as the many smaller steps that you must take to head in that direction. 

As with most things in this unpredictable world, there are no guarantees that you will reach your goal, but you will be a lot further along the path.

My definition of a ‘project’ seems to be quite broad, more like a lifelong project rather than short temporary ones. There are probably better terms to describe what this actually is.

At its core I believe you need to include your:
1. Long-term vision - what is the ultimate goal you want to achieve? Be grand, but also realistic, and make peace with the fact that you may never actually achieve the goal, but get closer to it.
2. Short-term actions - what small steps should you take to keep walking along this path toward your goal? Constant evaluation and adjusting may be required to ensure you don’t stray too far off the path. You may also realize that you do not even want to walk the path, or run into a fork in the road that takes you on a completely unexpected, but more interesting/rewarding/satisfying path. [^1]
