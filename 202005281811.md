*alphabetized*

A collection of printables that I have created or particularly like.

The main reason why I wanted to print my own paper was so that I could use this special sugar cane paper[^1]. It’s relatively thin, but also strong enough to hold fountain pen ink without it bleeding through to the back. For note-taking paper, I usually print the lines so they’re barely visible (also ink-saving) and because I want the appearance of a near-blank page with some guidelines so it’s not chaotic.

## Cornell Grid paper
The Cornell note-taking system helps you organize your (hand-written or digital) note paper more efficiently. It divides the paper into columns: the main body is for the notes (typically taken during a lecture or while reading), and the side column is for key words, concepts, or questions. I also write headings on the side column for readability and organization. An optional row on the bottom can be used to summarize the page (I don’t do this though).

### Features
- 0.5 cm grid
- title and date bar
- side column for key terms
