## What’s in it?
Useful knowledge, tips, how to’s, personal project notes, collections

It’s not entirely a Zettelkasten. I keep that separate as a more formal system to help me think about the world. I think of it more as an academic thinking partner.

The parts that I borrow, however include: atomic-ish notes, linking.
The part that is different is that I use this more as a way to store and organize knowledge that shouldn’t really go into a ZK, so really, it is more like a personal wiki.
To me, it makes more sense to organize things like this rather than to keep a blog, where you are stuck in a certain format of linear, fully written articles, that are mostly unchanged after publishing. I have tried starting a blog  multiple times but I know now that I cannot make such a commitment. It also fits in with my having multiple interests (see [[202006131545]]). I also like to think of entries as pages, rather than posts. Pages don’t feel so permanent or linear.

You may think that I should just call it a personal wiki or blog because that’s really what it is, but it just makes sense to me to call it a ‘digital garden’. It’s fun to think of yourself as a gardener, cultivating and tending to your internet garden, with different patches of different plants. 

## Why keep a digital garden?

- I have more incentive to write more clearly when I have an (imaginary) audience. 
- It encourages me to be short and succinct.
- It encourages me to write and share! I wouldn’t put this much effort in notes for myself, but if I know they might help others, I will put the effort into creating and polishing them.
- Serve as a resource for me. There is so much to keep track of, and this is a great way to store, and share knowledge.
- Who knows? The stuff I share could help someone. I feel like I’m contributing to something.
- Make sense of the information around me through organizing, curating, and writing.
- Hopefully encounter like-minded folks. 

Cons:
- It might be hard to keep up with what’s new - implementing an RSS feed for a few changes or small additions to each page is impractical (although I could collect new pages per month and share that)
- Not as polished as a blog. I hope not to create such fragmented notes, as I’m not aiming for a ZK, and I noticed that it’s difficult to follow other public ZKs as you have to keep clicking links, that lead to more links.
