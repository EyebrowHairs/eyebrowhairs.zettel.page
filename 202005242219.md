## What is it?

This is an ‘organization’ created to host a public Zettelkasten/wiki on Github. The Zettelkasten runs on [Neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page/), an app that can display Markdown files as webpages (and much more!).

The inspiration for its name came from the Esperanto word for ‘curator’.

The motto is:
> fostering personal and collective knowledge curation
