Saluton!

I had attempted to learn Esperanto many years ago, using Duolingo, but wasn’t motivated enough to continue when the grammar became to hard to keep up for my casual learning.

In March 2020, a modern friend ([[Modern friend]]) and I decided to learn Esperanto together, and I’m still going after 100+ days! Having someone to discuss and practice with makes the process much more enjoyable.

Duolingo has been helpful for learning the basics of grammar and maintaining a foundation of vocabulary, and I believe is mostly helpful due to the spaced-repetition of lessons. You are encouraged to work through each lesson up to level 5, and periodically maintain that level as you progress down a lesson tree. 

## Why learn Esperanto?
- supposedly easy to learn because of its regularity
- supposedly helps you learn other languages more easily (I would definitely say that there are many roots shared with French)
- communicate internationally with fellow Esperantists
- work-out your brain
- use it as a ‘secret’ language
