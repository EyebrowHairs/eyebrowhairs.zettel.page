I call myself an idealist, [neophile](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/neophilia), [multipotentialite](Multipotentialism.md), and [practicer](https://www.reddit.com/r/1000daysofpractice/).

I have always wanted to start a blog, but after many attempts, found that I couldn’t commit to writing regular posts and didn’t want to be held back by the “blog” form (what I consider to be a strict format of linear, fully written posts that are mostly unchanged after publishing).

A [[Digital Garden]] allows me to create interconnected pages and notes that are neither permanent nor need to be viewed chronologically.

Besides, it’s fun to think of myself as a gardener, cultivating and tending to my internet ‘garden’, with sprawling plots of various plant-notes.

I have a semi-green thumb in real life, so let’s hope that it transfers here! 🌱👍
