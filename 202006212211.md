I am currently testing these templates for certain components of my digital garden ([[202006032203]]).

## Page template
- Title
- Epistemic disclosure (see [[202006182315]] for details)
- Intro/summary of page
- Body
- Updates (use level 4 headings as dates?)
- Resources/Further reading/Related/Links

## Collection Template
- Title
- Intro/summary of collection
- Indication of order (alphabetical, chronological, newest on top)
- Collection: links or full body - preferably links in case too many notes accumulate and makes it hard to load/scroll - can start drafts as full body and transfer to links.
- Resources/Further Reading/Related/Links

## Project Template
- Title
- Intro/inspiration
- Source/pattern
- Execution
- Thoughts/Lessons
- Progress
- Related/Resources/Links
