## Set-up
- Repository: Can be found on Github [source](https://github.com/EyebrowHairs/eyebrowhairs.zettel.page)
- Hosting: Github pages
- Publishing: Uses [Neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page/) to publish files to the web
- Alternative back-up: Dropbox

## Workflow
- I use [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/) to edit files and the Github Desktop Client to push/pull any changes to the repository.
- Alternatives: I can directly edit files on the Github repository, or use [Cerveau](http://www.cerveau.app/), the web-interface for Neuron (currently in beta).

## Templates
I am currently testing these templates for certain components of my digital garden ([[202006032203]]).

### Page template

- Epistemic disclosure (see [[Digital Garden Terms of Service]] for details)

### Collection Template
- Title
- Intro/summary of collection
- Indication of order (alphabetical, chronological, newest on top)
