## Set-up
Repository: Can be found on [Github](https://github.com/EyebrowHairs/eyebrowhairs.zettel.page).
Hosting: 
App: Uses [Neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page/) to publish files to the web.
Alternative back-up: Dropbox

## Workflow
I use [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/) to edit files and the Github Desktop Client to push/pull any changes to the repository.
Alternatives: I can directly edit files on the Github repository, or use Cerveau, the web-interface for Neuron (currently in beta).

## Templates
I am currently testing these templates for certain components of my digital garden ([[202006032203]]).

### Collection Template
- Title
- Intro/summary of collection
