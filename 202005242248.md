After I saw this project ([https://www.ravelry.com/projects/flipid/perla](https://www.ravelry.com/projects/flipid/perla)), I’ve been inspired by modern hanboks, and am also in the middle of using up my yarn stash, so I decided to combine the two ideas.

A hanbok is part of traditional Korean folk clothing and typically feature a wrap-style tied front, which is what I wanted to replicate.

## Inspiration

## Pattern
I must have gone through hundreds of patterns to find the perfect one, which doesn’t exist. 
So I settled on one to modify: [https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/f933-bolero](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/f933-bolero)

The main reasons I chose this include:
1. Yarn weight - the yarn I have is worsted weight
2. Raglan sleeve - I want to work in one piece with no seams and customize the length, plus it’s top-down so I can try it on as I go
3. I can understand the pattern  - to make modifications for the front to wrap

## Execution
I probably should have done more research first, but it was good to see what came out of my first attempt. The fabric was too stiff and heavy, and it seemed small.

After researching on how to fix this inherent problem in crochet, I came across the concept of using slip stitches. Slip stitches seemed to be a good fit for the fabric, as it supposedly takes up less yarn and is thinner than a traditional crochet stitch ([https://www.designingvashti.com/learn/slip-stitch-crochet-faq/](https://www.designingvashti.com/learn/slip-stitch-crochet-faq/)). 

But…it’s a pain to work with. Hence, I was happy to discover the [half-double crochet (HDC) slip stitch](https://daisyfarmcrafts.com/half-double-slip-stitch/).

I modified the stitch to become a DC slip stitch. It looks very much like a HDC stitch, but is slightly thinner. A common principle of working with slip stitches is to use a bigger hook, so I also switched from a H to a J hook (the next size of hook that I have).

So, with a technique to create a better fabric, I also had to modify the pattern. 

Instead of alternating SC and DC, I would be working only in DCSS. I also noticed an interesting pattern after a few rows, it creates a visible line every 2 rows, which is what the original pattern did as well.

To modify the front, I opted to increase twice every row, and count each turning chain as a stitch to keep the edge clean.

## Progress
2020-05-24 - I finished the yoke, separated the sleeves, and am working on the body. I will break off and work on the sleeves before returning to the body, to ensure there is enough yarn. The body can be shorter if needed, as it is meant to be slightly cropped.

2020-06-24 - Haven’t made much progress. I had started one sleeve a few weeks ago. Slightly unhappy with the fit so far, but I will persist.

## Next time
I doubt I would make this again, but if I did, next time I would start with a longer starting chain (add 4, one for each increase) to make the neck slightly larger so there is more room for a collar.

## Thoughts
It is extremely WARM. Definitely something for the winter…
