- Typewriter simulator: https://uniqcode.com/typewriter/
- An introduction to LaTeX: [https://trms.me/a-gentle-introduction-to-latex/](https://trms.me/a-gentle-introduction-to-latex/) - I thought it was some confusing formatting thing for math people. I now think it’s slightly less confusing!
- Plaintext productivity: [http://plaintext-productivity.net/](http://plaintext-productivity.net/) - what persuaded me to use MD files for my notes
- todo.txt: [https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt) - a plain text to-do system - the only thing is, there is no easy way to set reoccurring habits

     - [https://jhornitzky.github.io/yolograph/demo/](https://jhornitzky.github.io/yolograph/demo/) - shows you what percentage of years you lived based on an average lifespan of 70 years
     - [http://pewu.github.io/life-in-weeks/](http://pewu.github.io/life-in-weeks/) - customizable
     - [https://lifecal.me/](https://lifecal.me/) - an app
