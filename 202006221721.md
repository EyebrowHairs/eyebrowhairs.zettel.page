This is pretty much a link dump :)

An add-on to Pocket (an article bookmarker) called [AcceleReader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/accelereader-power-up-you/ndaldjfflhocdageglcnflfanmdhgfbi) which shows you how many articles you have (I don’t know why that’s not a feature of Pocket itself), and presents you a random article to read. 
- As of 2020-06-03 I have 3000+ articles sitting in there and I plan to start going through them! The randomizer can be set to present you the shortest article, so I will start with those and work my way up.

Leave compliments for random people. My small collection of printable tear-off compliments: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewEveryDay/comments/bdible/leave_compliments_for_random_people/)

A year ago, I randomly decided to pick up this script called Vianaic, which looks cool and can be used as a secret code (if you can remember what the letters are…). My modification of the script: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/vianaic/comments/at9ia4/my_new_modified_script/)

[Typewriter simulator](https://uniqcode.com/typewriter/) - haven’t you always wanted to type on a typewriter? They do sell modern typewriters these days, but this site lets you hear the sounds and experience the frustration of hitting the wrong key and getting keys stuck when you type too fast.

[An introduction to LaTeX](https://trms.me/a-gentle-introduction-to-latex/) - I thought it was some confusing formatting thing for math people. I now think it’s slightly less confusing!

[Plaintext productivity](http://plaintext-productivity.net/) - what persuaded me to use MD files for my notes

[todo.txt](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt) - a plain text to-do system - the only thing is, there is no easy way to set reoccurring habits with this system

[Origami tray for desk](https://www.paperkawaii.com/origami-long-tray-tutorial/) - originally uses A4 paper, but you can use Letter size paper. I would subtract around 5 cm off the width to make a slimmer tray

A cool concept of displaying your life in story: [Life in weeks](https://notes.busterbenson.com/life-in-weeks)
   - I am reminded of this [site](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html), where I first encountered the ‘life in weeks’ idea: 
   - other apps/sites that help you visualize or track your life (yes, I looked at the comments):
    - [https://zrxj5vvjvl.codesandbox.io/](https://zrxj5vvjvl.codesandbox.io/)
     - [https://jhornitzky.github.io/yolograph/demo/](https://jhornitzky.github.io/yolograph/demo/) - shows you what percentage of years you lived based on an average lifespan of 70 years
     - [http://pewu.github.io/life-in-weeks/](http://pewu.github.io/life-in-weeks/) - customizable
     - [https://lifecal.me/](https://lifecal.me/) - an app
     - [https://entire.life/](https://entire.life/) - a webapp?
