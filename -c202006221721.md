[Hot Pepper Hands](https://www.thekitchn.com/the-best-remedies-for-hot-pepper-hands-tips-from-the-kitchn-208527) (a.k.a. 🔥🙌) - I had never experienced this before until yesterday, after I unknowingly cut up a bag full of *hot* peppers, and I will just say that it is an *extremely* unpleasant sensation. I tried dish soap, vinegar, baking soda, oil, and rubbing alcohol, which, sad to say, did not work for me. When it was time to sleep, I had a major flare up of FIRE-LAVA-MOLTEN ROCK pain and eventually resorted to holding a bottle of cold water in my hands until I lost consciousness. (that worked!)

[OBS (Open Broadcaster Software)](https://obsproject.com/) - allows you to customize the  layout of a presentation screen, which can be used in video meetings in place of the default layout of the software (example: video screen might be too small in a slideshow-view). Originally seen in this [article](https://medium.com/@cs50/teaching-from-home-via-zoom-c3b336446fbc).

## 2020-07-04
[Elizabeth I](https://www.elizabethi.org/) - I don’t remember why or how I discovered this site, but I read a majority of the articles last year and I thought it was a nice, light introduction to Queen Elizabeth I’s history

## 2020-07-02
[McGill Personal Finance Essentials Course](https://mcgillpersonalfinance.com/) - learn the basics of financial literacy (geared towards Canadians)

[Pasta Grannies](https://www.youtube.com/user/pastagrannies) - if you like pasta and food videos, here is a Youtube channel documenting the art of handmade Italian pasta

## 2020-07-01
[Thoughtless](https://thoughtless.now.sh/) by [Paco Coursey](https://paco.im/blog/be-thoughtless) - a cool concept that encourages you to write down what’s on your mind while gradually fading the words away. The text is still there, so you can copy the whole thing when you’re done.

[UserInyerface](https://userinyerface.com/) → (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

## 2020-06-30
[Johnny Decimal](https://johnnydecimal.com/) - a system to organize your files. Specifically, I want to borrow the 10 areas/10 categories idea and the numbering system.

## 2020-06-27
[Printable 3D letters](https://mrprintables.com/3d-alphabet-templates.html) - some assembly required, but it’s free if you’re looking for some DIY decor

[Every Noise At Once](http://everynoise.com/) - (not actually playing at all at once, thankfully) a nifty site that showcases TONS of different and sometimes very niche genres. You can click on a genre to hear a sample clip, and dive one level deeper to see more related artists, genres, and the ‘opposing’ genres.

[Memex](https://getmemex.com/#) - it’s like Pocket, but apparently better. Still in the early stages though. Your bookmarks and history are indexed so that you can perform a full-text search.
- I tried to import my Pocket articles and regular bookmarks. Apparently ~200 of my old bookmarks were dead! A lot of the links didn’t import if they were blocked by a log-in page, so I would recommend just importing the title/date/URLS instead of the whole article (in the import settings).
- thoughts: 
    - consolidates all Pocket articles and bookmarks into one place
    - you can tag, annotate and add notes to webpages
    - quick search from search bar
    - needs work on organizing links, can’t mass edit yet
    - there’s some sort of backup system, but I haven’t tried it
    - takes you right to the link. It’s not really focused on article *reading*, so there’s no reading time estimate
    - just discovered a mobile app, but unfortunately you need to pay to sync those bookmarks to the desktop one, which is a bummer, since Pocket does that for free.
    - will keep an eye on it in the meantime!
- Pocket thoughts:
    - Good things about Pocket - services to send articles to Kindle, the AcceleReader extension below, easy to set up, stores articles offline on phone, clean look - focused on visuals (shows thumbnails), Pocket recommendations email (interesting reads), can save PDFs, save-to-pocket extension on phone
    - Not so good things - hard to search for articles, hard to edit many articles at once, displays a minimal view of the article, although they display a link to the original article (the view is nice sometimes, but also leaves a lot of things out), limited highlights (and only on the reading mode)

An add-on to Pocket (an article bookmarker) called [AcceleReader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/accelereader-power-up-you/ndaldjfflhocdageglcnflfanmdhgfbi) which shows you how many articles you have (I don’t know why that’s not a feature of Pocket itself), and presents you a random article to read. 
- Currently, I have 3000+ articles sitting in there and I plan to start going through them! The randomizer can be set to present you the shortest article, so I will start with those and work my way up.

Leave compliments for random people. My small collection of printable tear-off compliments: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewEveryDay/comments/bdible/leave_compliments_for_random_people/)

A year ago, I randomly decided to pick up this script called Vianaic, which looks cool and can be used as a secret code (if you can remember what the letters are…). My modification of the script: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/vianaic/comments/at9ia4/my_new_modified_script/)

[Typewriter simulator](https://uniqcode.com/typewriter/) - haven’t you always wanted to type on a typewriter? They do sell modern typewriters these days, but this site lets you hear the sounds and experience the frustration of hitting the wrong key and getting keys stuck when you type too fast.

[An introduction to LaTeX](https://trms.me/a-gentle-introduction-to-latex/) - I thought it was some confusing formatting thing for math people. I now think it’s slightly less confusing!

[Plaintext productivity](http://plaintext-productivity.net/) - what persuaded me to use MD files for my notes

[todo.txt](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt) - a plain text to-do system - the only thing is, there is no easy way to set reoccurring habits with this system

## 2020-06-23
[Origami tray for desk](https://www.paperkawaii.com/origami-long-tray-tutorial/) - originally uses A4 paper, but you can use Letter size paper. I would subtract around 5 cm off the width to make a slimmer tray

A cool concept of displaying your life in story: [Life in weeks](https://notes.busterbenson.com/life-in-weeks)
   - I am reminded of this [site](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html), where I first encountered the ‘life in weeks’ idea: 
   - other apps/sites that help you visualize or track your life (yes, I looked at the comments):
    - [https://zrxj5vvjvl.codesandbox.io/](https://zrxj5vvjvl.codesandbox.io/)
     - [https://jhornitzky.github.io/yolograph/demo/](https://jhornitzky.github.io/yolograph/demo/) - shows you what percentage of years you lived based on an average lifespan of 70 years
     - [http://pewu.github.io/life-in-weeks/](http://pewu.github.io/life-in-weeks/) - customizable
     - [https://lifecal.me/](https://lifecal.me/) - an app
     - [https://entire.life/](https://entire.life/) - a webapp?
