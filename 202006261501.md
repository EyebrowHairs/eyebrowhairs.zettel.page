I recently turned off notifications for email on my phone, and realized that I haven’t missed them at all. I get email notifications on my computer anyways, so there was no point in being notified twice on generally non-urgent matters. 

The thing is, I didn’t even think to do that for the longest time. 

I had just accepted the fact that I should check my phone every time I heard a *bzz*.

Lately, I’ve been into journaling, and that has made me more aware of my actions and thoughts, and of things affecting my actions and thoughts, like distractions.

So I analyzed the notifications I got on my phone and computer and selectively chose what I wanted to be notified about. If it was something that I routinely ignored, like the redundant email notifications, or even regular emails from companies or things I signed up for, then I removed it. If it was something valuable or useful, then I kept it. This seems like such an obvious thing to do in hindsight, but sometimes these things are so engrained in our daily lives that we don’t stop to think about it.

I even added more notifications! I’ve been trying to make myself follow a more regular schedule on the weekdays, so I added alarms notifying me when it was time to transition to different periods, like eating meals, or getting ready for bed, or even one just to check in how I was doing in the afternoon.

Now, I don’t always stick to the alarms, but they’re helpful to remind me about the passage of time throughout the day, which tends to fly by if I don’t pay attention.

Another type of ‘notification’ I added is even more prominent. I keep a sticky note on top of the computer screen, and on it I write the one task I would like to work on for the hour and any other important reminders I need for the day. 

Thus, my days are now filled with intentional notifications, that are actually helpful to me. 

**TL;DR: Notifications aren’t always annoying or bad, some are even helpful, but try to control the type you get.**
