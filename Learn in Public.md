I thought it would be interesting to publish my notes in order to Learn in Public[^1]. To keep myself focused, the general theme will be **connection** (yeah, I know, it's really broad, but it's better than *everything*).

## [[Systems Thinking]]#
I first encountered this topic at school (Winter 2021) and was really fascinated with it! As of March 2021 I will be doing some independent readings to explore the subject further.

<!-- 

## [[Metadata]]#
Also encountered in school. My least favourite class actually, but a few interesting topics include: linked data, ontologies, and the semantic web.

## [[Human Connections]]#
How do we learn from and make sense of the world? How do we connect to ourselves and others? Will possibly include topics such as: learning theories, sociology, anthropology, psychology, and philosophy.

## [[Library]]
The sharing of interesting and/or informative media (books, articles, podcasts, etc.)
