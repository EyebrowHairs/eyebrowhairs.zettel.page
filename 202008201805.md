> If the only reason you're not pursuing a dream is because of the length of time it will take to achieve it, you should start right now. Think long-term. - James Clear

Recently I have been frustrated at my lack of discipline and I thought this quote was a good perspective-changer. I realize that I am prone to wanting to complete quick-gratification projects, but donâ€™t often think about how continuing on, or persisting in doing/learning something will help in the long run.

I think creating [[202008201826]] <!-- project pages -->could be helpful in setting out long-term visions and short-term actions.
