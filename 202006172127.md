## a.k.a. How to navigate

[2020-06-03]

Old Notes on navigation (which I will probably not use now)
- file type:
- C-collection - lists
- P-projects - things I’m working on
- O-outline - of ideas/concepts - potentially not use?
- R-reference - files to reference

Why name files this way?
- prevent too many folders
- can scroll through all notes
- see at at glance what type of note it is

Recently, I came across an interesting system of note organization that I believe will suit my purposes. It’s titled [**IMF**](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/imf-advanced-starter-kit-v2/390), meaning Index, Maps, and Frameworks. I loosely follow Zettelkasten ([[202006172213]]) principles when creating and organizing my notes, and the system calls for a flat, non-hierarchical layout of notes when starting out. You connect notes to each other if they are related, and over time, you are supposed to see clusters or themes emerge.

Well. I will say that I honestly tried it out, but my mind couldn’t handle the chaos.

It can be daunting to open up your notes and see a huge list of seemingly unstructured notes. The links are within the notes, not visible, and I don’t believe there were any fancy graph visualization software available back then (at least I didn’t think to use any).
