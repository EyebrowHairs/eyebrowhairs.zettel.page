## a.k.a. How to navigate

[2020-06-03]

Old Notes on navigation (which I will probably not use now)
- file type:
- C-collection - lists
- P-projects - things I’m working on
- O-outline - of ideas/concepts - potentially not use?
- R-reference - files to reference

Why name files this way?
- prevent too many folders
- can scroll through all notes
- see at at glance what type of note it is

Recently, I came across an interesting system of note organization that I believe will suit my purposes. It’s titled [**IMF**](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/imf-advanced-starter-kit-v2/390), meaning Index, Maps, and Frameworks. I loosely follow Zettelkasten ([[202006172213]]) principles when creating and organizing my notes, and the system calls for a flat, non-hierarchical layout of notes when starting out. You connect notes to each other if they are related, and over time, you are supposed to see clusters or themes emerge.

Well. I will say that I honestly tried it out, but my mind couldn’t handle the chaos.

It can be daunting to open up your notes and see a huge list of seemingly unstructured notes. The links are within the notes, not visible, and I don’t believe there were any fancy graph visualization software available back then (at least I didn’t think to use any). 

This method adds another layer of organization over these notes, without restricting them to folders or categories. The notes are still free to associate with each other, but you now have a way to view them in an orderly manner. I think of it like a portal. In its simplest form, it can be a note that lists the top tier ‘stucture’ notes. In a more elaborate form, it can organize those top notes into themes.

Once I have around 100 notes I’ll start organizing them.
