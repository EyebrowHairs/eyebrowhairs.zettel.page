## What is it?

A way to make sure you have everything you need before starting an activity. Akin to the concept of [mise en place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_place).

It helps you get everything organized, and provides you with a process to get set-up. This will hopefully decrease the friction or barrier to get started, by reducing the need to make decisions and remember what exactly you need to get started.

The kit includes:
1. Material List
    - A list of everything you need before starting an activity
2. Set-up Instructions
    - Any instructions needed for setting up your environment
3. Items
    - The actual items, if physical, or if desired, assemble into a folder a copy of files/websites/apps/links/etc., if digital
