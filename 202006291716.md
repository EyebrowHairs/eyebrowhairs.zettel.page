## History
I took piano lessons as a child, which I remember not enjoying at all. However, it did give me an introduction into the world of music. Although I stopped taking lessons, my parents got me a small keyboard that I would play occasionally. The lesson book I had used a 5 finger-system that made it easy to play the music without necessarily reading the notes (which is why I still have trouble today with piano-note reading ðŸ˜­). 

I eventually joined band in elementary school, playing the clarinet. Thanks to my previous musical knowledge, I had little trouble reading the notes and took to the clarinet pretty well, continuing to high school and attending summer music camps; fun times!

Past high school, I stopped playing for a while, only playing a few times a year. After university, I decided to take up the violin and took weekly lessons (itâ€™s so much harder than I thought ðŸ˜“) until I moved the next summer, when I took up guitar (which I dabbled with a few years prior). In the new city, I decided to join a community band and was reunited with the clarinet. 

In the spring of 2020, by strange circumstances, I was able to borrow a violin and am dabbling with it once again!

## Violin ðŸŽ»
### Left hand posture
- I had a hard time trying to figure out the left hand, but I think I figured it out now. The wrist should be kept at a straight angle, which shifts the fingers so that their left edges touch the strings. Unfortunately this conflicts slightly with the guitar (fingers press strings relatively straight on, not angled), so I have to keep that in mind.
