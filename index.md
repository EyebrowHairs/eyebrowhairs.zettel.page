## 🌷🌱🌹 Welcome to my digital garden! 🌼🌿🌻

Part-blog and part-personal wiki, this is a place where I curate and share my more useful ‘brain dumps’.

### About the gardener

> If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put the foundations under them. ~ Henry David Thoreau

An idealist, neophile (see <202006131503>), [multipotentialite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipotentiality), and “avid [practicer](https://www.reddit.com/r/1000daysofpractice/)”. 

I have always wanted to start a blog, but after many attempts, I found that I couldn’t commit to writing regular posts and didn’t want to be held back by the “blog” format, what I consider to be a strict format of linear, fully written posts that are mostly unchanged after publishing.

A digital garden allows me to create interconnected pages that are neither permanent nor need to be viewed linearly (chronologically).

Besides, it’s fun to think of myself as a gardener, cultivating and tending to my internet ‘garden’, with sprawling plots of various plants.

I have a semi-green thumb in real life, so let’s hope it transfers here. 🌱
