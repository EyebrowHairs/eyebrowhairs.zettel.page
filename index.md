## 🌷🌱🌹 Welcome to my digital garden! 🌼🌿🌻

Part-blog and part-personal wiki, this is a place where I curate and share my more useful notes.

### About the gardener

> If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put the foundations under them. ~ Henry David Thoreau

An idealist, neophile ([[202006131503]]), [multipotentialite]([[202006131545]]), and “avid” [practicer](https://www.reddit.com/r/1000daysofpractice/). 

I have always wanted to start a blog, but after many attempts, found that I couldn’t commit to writing regular posts and didn’t want to be held back by the “blog” form (what I consider to be a strict format of linear, fully written posts that are mostly unchanged after publishing).

A digital garden ([[202006032203]]) allows me to create interconnected pages and notes that are neither permanent nor need to be viewed linearly (chronologically).

Besides, it’s fun to think of myself as a gardener, cultivating and tending to my internet ‘garden’, with sprawling plots of various plant-notes.

I have a semi-green thumb in real life, so let’s hope that it transfers here! 🌱👍
