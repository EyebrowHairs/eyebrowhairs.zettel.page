A summary of the apps and systems I’m currently using (a.k.a. am reliant on) to organize my life. Will my life fall apart without a computer/phone/internet? 

## Events
- Google Calendar - syncs across devices and can subscribe to other calendars

## Tasks
- Todoist - can sort by categories, set reoccurring tasks (like reminders to water my plants), and also sync across devices. I’m planning not to use the Google calendar integration because I don’t need all that duplication.
- Analogue - I plan my day on paper, but look to Todoist for scheduled/urgent tasks and reminders. 

## Accountability
- Habitica - I put my daily ‘routine’ here and joined a party with a friend to keep it fun.
- r/1000daysofpractice - A place to log my music practice and keep on top of what other people are doing and occasionally cheer them on

## Notes
- Zettlr - I am debating what to keep exclusively in here. Definitely will keep my Zettelkasten here, and a few other long-term notes. However, it’s not the most accessible place to view notes in my opinion. 
- Notion - a web-based app, so I have to be careful what to store here. It’s great for visuals, like a recipe collection, embedding documents, and information I want to access fairly quickly and regularly, like a mood/inspirational board. I was using it for task management but it was too much work to maintain it. I feel like it will be difficult to determine whether to place something in Notion or Zettlr. Maybe the determining question is : accessibility or long-term storage? I can also export files to MD, but they won’t be in sync and it’s not something I would maintain regularly as a lazy person.
- Digital Garden - also a note-repository, but for public viewing. This is accessed primarily through Zettlr so I have the option of viewing those notes with my private ones. They’re kept mainly separate though, since I can only link one way (private to public).
- Analogue - I write notes by hand pretty much everywhere, on loose-leaf, notebooks, notepads. It’s quite a mess but I enjoy using my fountain pens too much to switch exclusively to digital note-taking. I also suck at typing so writing by hand is less painful. However, I do plan to transcribe some of the more important notes I take to my Zettelkasten, which means I need a system to denote which notes have been transcribed, or need processing. Perhaps file folders will do, and a symbol at the corner of a page.

## Prevention
- A site and app blocker for computer and phone, to limit time spent on those fun but time-wasting sites/apps during ‘work hours’. 

## Time-management
- Various alarms to be mindful of the time of day, since sometimes the day zooms right by! 
- An alarm clock for the weekdays. I tend to revert to sleeping late/waking late without an alarm, and unfortunately need to keep a regular sleep schedule for school. 
- I try to leave the weekends somewhat free because I need some spontaneity in my life to stay sane.
