This is a brief overview of my version of the Zettelkasten Method. It is based on my undocumented readings of a variety of sources, of which I may not remember exactly.
:::

## The Method

A coming-together of ideas. Ideas represented as individual notes. Notes that link ideas to one another, not bound by categorical boundaries. Over time, clusters of ideas emerge into bigger topics.

## The Components

1) Literature Repository/Library

   - A place to hold references or links to sources such as books, articles, links, media, etc.
2) Literature Notes

   - Notes derived directly from a source. Can be a dump.
3) Zettels

   - Atomic ideas derived from Literature Notes, thoughts, or directly from sources.
   - Links should always have context. No dumping of links allowed.
4) Topic Notes

   - Topics that emerge from multiple Zettels over time. A portal with context. Zettels may belong to 0 or many Topic Notes.

## Discovery

I came across the Zettelkasten method back in the spring of 2019. Unfortunately, there weren't many resources around (although Christian and Sascha over at [zettelkasten.de](https://zettelkasten.de/) have been a huge help!), so I decided to start the subreddit [r/Zettelkasten](https://www.reddit.com/r/Zettelkasten/) to provide a place to gather resources and find like-minded people.

The activity was slow to non-existent at the start, but fast-forward one year, and you will find that the activity levels have skyrocketed[^1]

One year ago, I read almost every article I could possibly find on the internet on the Zettelkasten method.

Now, I can hardly keep up with the output!

In order to make sense of all this information, I am currently part of a [team](https://github.com/Kuratoro) maintaining a [public Zettelkasten](https://zk.zettel.page/) on the Zettelkasten method itself. It’s not perfect and progress is slow-going, but it’s a start, and I hope to keep the momentum going for as long as possible.
