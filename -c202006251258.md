## How to Read a Paper
Read a paper in 3 passes.

1. Bird’s eye view - 5 min
- Get a sense of what the paper is about; read the intro, headings, and conclusion, and determine whether to continue reading (if relevant or interesting)
- Questions to answer at this stage/guidelines for writing a good paper:
 >1. Category: What type of paper is this? A measurement paper? An analysis of an existing system? A description of a research prototype?
>2. Context: Which other papers is it related to? Which theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem?
>3. Correctness: Do the assumptions appear to be valid?
>4. Contributions: What are the paper’s main contributions?
>5. Clarity: Is the paper well written?

2. Content - 1 hour
- Actually read the paper thoroughly, you should be able to summarize the main ideas

3. Understand in depth - 4-5 hrs (1 if experienced)
- Re-implement the paper, identify and challenge every assumption, compare the reality with your understanding

## How to do a literature review
1. Find 4-5 recent articles and do a quick pass
2. Identify shared literature or author names
3. Look up recent conference proceedings for key authors and scan for other related work (it will usually be a top conference, hence a high quality of material overall)
