I believe I first encountered the concept of the bullet journal back in 2015. I used it for school and got suckered into using Moleskine notebooks (which I can’t leave now, after having gotten used to the size, the page colour). [^1]

I follow the principles very loosely, after trial and error.

Checkboxes/symbols, migration, page numbers, index, collections, letter to self on first page documenting date and life-snapshot.

## Some other journal related things:

Chronodex: [https://scription.typepad.com/](https://scription.typepad.com/) - a cool way to organize your day! Basically a clock-like template which you can write in/around. There are printables if you want to try it out, and I noticed that the creator has even released a physical notebook with his design, which is pretty neat! [^2]

Also see it’s cousin, the Spiraldex: [https://kentfromoz.blogspot.com/2013/05/introducing-spiraldex-visual-mapping.html](https://kentfromoz.blogspot.com/2013/05/introducing-spiraldex-visual-mapping.html)

After viewing the Scription blog above, you can’t help but notice what a awesome notebook he has! Why, it’s the Traveller’s Notebook: [https://www.jetpens.com/blog/travelers-notebook-a-comprehensive-guide/pt/726](https://www.jetpens.com/blog/travelers-notebook-a-comprehensive-guide/pt/726) - a leather refillable ‘notebook’. There is a community quite dedicated to these notebooks and I even got myself a knock-off version before deciding that I didn’t like the size or format of it. It’s got a rugged look, if you like that kind of thing. I prefer the simple look of a black Moleskine notebook. 

Hobonichi: [https://www.jetpens.com/blog/guide-to-the-hobonichi-techo-planner/pt/900](https://www.jetpens.com/blog/guide-to-the-hobonichi-techo-planner/pt/900) - based on a one-page per day format, with apparently very nice, thin paper. I tried to emulate the format of the pages in my own journal, but found that I didn’t have the time or energy to fill out a whole page every day. You can 

Something I find is that on social media and on forums, there is a lot of emphasis on how ‘beautiful’ your journal and spreads look like. I’m definitely not one to spend much time on decorating my pages, so I don’t think people should be too concerned about how neat or pretty your journal looks. Seriously, people go all out with fancy drawings, stickers, colours, etc. Do it if you want, but don’t feel pressured to make your pages *perfect*. It is simply a tool to help you get your life organized![^3]

[^1]: Although I do wish that the pages were more fountain pen friendly. I’ve been keeping two bottles of ink that I’d like to use up.
[^2]: Reading again, it was only a limited production back in 2018: [https://scription.typepad.com/blog/2018/08/chronodex-visual-scheduler-and-task-management-on-md-paper.html](https://scription.typepad.com/blog/2018/08/chronodex-visual-scheduler-and-task-management-on-md-paper.html)
[^3]: I don’t mean to put those who do beautify their journals down, perhaps I’m just bitter at my lack of artistic ability.
