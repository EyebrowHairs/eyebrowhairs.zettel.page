## What is it?
To me, a bullet journal is a modular analog system that acts as a planner and helps to organize your notes.

I believe I first encountered the concept of the bullet journal back in 2015. I used it for school purposes and got suckered into using Moleskine notebooks (which I canâ€™t leave now, after having gotten used to the size, the page colour). [^1]

After many years of trial and error, I now follow the principles very loosely after realizing that I donâ€™t bother to maintain certain things.

The elements that I usually include are:
- checkboxes/symbols to indicate todo items and regular notes
- migration of previous useful content to the next journal
- page numbers
- an index to keep track of page numbers
- collections (ex. phone numbers, things I donâ€™t want to keep in my brain but need to find easily)
- letter to self on first page documenting date and life-snapshot (this is )

## A small complaint
Something I find is that on social media and on forums, there is a lot of emphasis on how â€˜beautifulâ€™ your journal and spreads look like. Iâ€™m definitely not one to spend much time on decorating my pages, so I donâ€™t think people should be too concerned about how neat or pretty your journal looks. Seriously, people go all out with fancy drawings, stickers, colours, etc. Do it if you want, but donâ€™t feel pressured to make your pages *perfect*. It is simply a tool to help you get your life organized![^3]

## Other journal related things:
- [Chronodex](https://scription.typepad.com/) - a cool way to organize your day! Basically a clock-like template which you can write in/around. There are printables if you want to try it out, and I noticed that the creator has even released a physical notebook with his design, which is pretty neat! [^2]

- Also see its cousin, the [Spiraldex](https://kentfromoz.blogspot.com/2013/05/introducing-spiraldex-visual-mapping.html)

- After viewing the Scription blog above, you canâ€™t help but notice what a awesome notebook he has! Why, itâ€™s the [Travellerâ€™s Notebook](https://www.jetpens.com/blog/travelers-notebook-a-comprehensive-guide/pt/726) - a leather refillable â€˜notebookâ€™. There is a community quite dedicated to these notebooks and I even got myself a knock-off version before deciding that I didnâ€™t like the size or format (or floppiness) of it. Itâ€™s got a rugged look, if you like that kind of thing. I prefer the simple look of a black notebook. 

- [Hobonichi](https://www.jetpens.com/blog/guide-to-the-hobonichi-techo-planner/pt/900) - based on a one-page per day format, with apparently very nice, thin paper. I tried to emulate the format of the pages in my own journal, but found that I didnâ€™t have the time or energy to fill out a whole page every day.

[^1]: Although I do wish that the pages were more fountain pen friendly. Iâ€™ve been keeping two bottles of ink that Iâ€™d like to use up. Apparently [Rhodia](https://www.rhodiapads.com/collections_boutique_webnotebook.php) is a good alternative.
