:::

These are recipes that I have (successfully) tested and adapted. I don‚Äôt cook regularly but will have to in the future, so it never hurts to be prepared. üòÖ

Instructions may be a bit sparse as they are more like reminders, but I have linked to the original (or similar) recipes, with more detailed instructions.

## Hummus
Makes 1 ¬Ω cups

### Instructions
Look in the link below! I didn‚Äôt alter anything when I made it.

### Notes
- Very filling!
- I used some leftover peanut butter instead of tahini, but will try to make some tahini next time.

## Steamed Cake
Makes an 8‚Äù cake (somewhat on the thinner side)

### Ingredients
- 1 cup flour (minus 2 tbsp) - use cake flour for extra lightness
- 1 tsp baking powder
- ¬º tsp salt
- 5 eggs
- ¬Ω tsp lemon juice - to stabilize the egg whites
- ‚Öì to ¬Ω cup sugar - I reduced the sugar by around half as I don‚Äôt like to make food too sweet. (I also make up for this when decorating, with frosting, etc.)
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- Chocolate variation = ¬º cup cocoa + ¬æ  cup flour (minus 2 tbsp)

### Instructions
1. Line pan with parchment, set up steamer with water and steamer basket
2. Sift dry ingredients together into a separate bowl
3. Separate eggs
4. Beat whites until frothy, add ¬Ω the sugar and beat for ~1 min
6. Add yolks, remaining sugar, and vanilla, beat for ~ 2 min
7. Start heating up the water so that the steamer is ready
8. Add dry to wet ingredients, mix and fold to incorporate fully
9. Pour cake batter into pan, tap twice to eliminate bubbles,  steam 20 min, or until it passes the toothpick test
10. Cool cake, decorate if you‚Äôd like, eat!

### Notes
- I used a bamboo steamer, lined it with parchment paper, and steamed it directly in the basket. You can do this if you don‚Äôt care much for looks. The benefit of a bamboo steamer is that the lid doesn‚Äôt collect water that can drip back onto your food. 
- You can use a big pot/pan, place a small rack in the middle, and set your pan on top of that. The rack should raise the pan above water level. You can also wrap the inside of the lid with a huge sheet of paper towel to reduce the dripping. 
- I watched quite a few Youtube videos prior to making this, but the basic principles are similar. The egg whites need to be whipped to create a light structure.

## Microwave Granola
Makes up to a week of daily granola for me (I use 4-5 tbsp to top my yogurt).

### Ingredients
- 3 tbsp honey/syrup
- 2 tbsp water
- 2 tbsp oil/butter
- pinch salt
- 1 cup rolled oats
- 3 tbsp nuts/seeds
- Optional add-in: spices/vanilla, dried fruit

### Instructions
1. Mix all together except dried fruit
2. Microwave 50% power for 5 minutes, stir halfway. Optional microwave up to 1 minute full power to make crunchier
3. Add fruit, stir and let cool to harden

### Notes
 I wouldn‚Äôt really recommend increasing the batch, unless you split it and microwave each batch separately (to prevent burning and to make sure it is all cooked).

## Yogurt from Scratch (but you do need a bit of yogurt to start)
Makes a little less than 2-4 cups.

### Ingredients
- 2-4 cups milk - the higher the fat content the better
- 1 tbsp yogurt/cup of milk - must include active bacterial culture
- Optional add-in: dry milk powder if desired to make thicker (¬Ω cup per 4 cups)

### Instructions
1. Boil milk on medium heat until frothy, stir constantly to prevent burning on the bottom - optional: keep simmering for 15-20 minutes to condense the milk and make thicker yogurt
2. Let cool to a warm temperature (until the container is warm, or is it warm to touch) - I let it sit for around an hour. Feel free to remove the skin that forms on top, or just eat it :D
3. Stir in yogurt until well blended - To prevent yogurt chunks from floating around, you can use a whisk, or scoop the yogurt into a small bowl, and add some of the warm milk to thin it out, then add the whole mixture back in
4. Keep mixture warm until it turns thicker - can take 8+ hours - keep in oven or cooler with hot a jar of water, wrap in towel. The longer you leave it, the more sour it becomes. The ideal temperature is around 40 degrees C. 
5. Refrigerate when thickened
	6. Optional: strain the yogurt to make thicker (like Greek yogurt)

### Notes
- Why make yogurt? The power of fermentation is pretty awesome, you save some money, you use less plastic containers.
- There are recipes out there that say you should measure the temperature of the milk and such, but I don‚Äôt have a thermometer so I found that this also works.
- Always use clean containers for storage and be sure to use your judgement to check whether it has gone bad or not. Whey (a yellow-ish byproduct fluid) is normal. Weird spots and funky smells are not. 
- Note: I live in a cooler climate, so I add more yogurt. Depending on how warm your area is, either use less yogurt (¬Ω the amount), or leave it for less time. You can check your yogurt after 4 hours to see how it‚Äôs doing, and adjust from there.
- Supposedly, you can just use some of this batch to make the next batch! I haven‚Äôt tried it yet but in theory, it should work.
