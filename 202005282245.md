## Microwave Granola
Original recipe: [https://www.powerhungry.com/2014/03/5-minute-5-ingredient-microwave-mug-granola/](https://www.powerhungry.com/2014/03/5-minute-5-ingredient-microwave-mug-granola/)
Makes up to a week of daily granola for me (I use 4-5 tbsp to top my yogurt). I wouldn’t really recommend increasing the batch, unless you split it and microwave each batch separately (to prevent burning and to make sure it is all cooked).

### Ingredients
- 3 tbsp honey/syrup
- 2 tbsp water
- 2 tbsp oil/butter
- pinch salt
- 1 cup rolled oats
- 3 tbsp nuts/seeds
- Optional add-in: spices/vanilla, dried fruit

### Instructions
1. Mix all together except dried fruit
2. Microwave 50% power for 5 minutes, stir halfway. Optional microwave up to 1 minute full power to make crunchier
3. Add fruit, stir and let cool to harden

## Yogurt
Makes a little less than 2-4 cups.
There are recipes out there that say you should measure the temperature of the milk and such, but I don’t have a thermometer so I found that this also works.
Always use clean containers for storage and be sure to use your judgement to check whether it has gone bad or not. Whey (a yellow-ish byproduct fluid) is normal. Weird spots and funky smells are not. 
Note: I live in a cooler climate, so I add more yogurt. Depending on how warm your area is, either use less yogurt (½ the amount), or leave it for less time. You can check your yogurt after 4 hours to see how it’s doing, and adjust from there.

Here is another one: [https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-yogurt-at-home-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-125070](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-yogurt-at-home-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-125070)

### Ingredients
- 2-4 cups milk - the higher the fat content the better
- 1 tbsp yogurt/cup of milk - must include active bacterial culture
- Optional add-in: dry milk powder if desired to make thicker (½ cup per 4 cups)

### Instructions
1. Boil milk on medium heat until frothy, stir constantly to prevent burning on the bottom - optional: keep simmering for 15-20 minutes to condense the milk and make thicker yogurt
2. Let cool to a warm temperature (until the container is warm, or is it warm to touch) - I let it sit for around an hour
3. Stir in yogurt until well blended
4. Keep mixture warm until it turns thicker - can take 8+ hours - keep in oven or cooler with hot a jar of water, wrap in towel. The longer you leave it, the more sour it becomes. The ideal temperature is around 40 degrees C. 
5. Refrigerate when thickened
	6. Optional: strain the yogurt to make thicker (like Greek yogurt)
