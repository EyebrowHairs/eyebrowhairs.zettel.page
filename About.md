# About the Gardener

> If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put the foundations under them. ~ Henry David Thoreau

I call myself an idealist, [neophile](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/neophilia), [multipotentialite](Multipotentialism.md), and [practicer](https://www.reddit.com/r/1000daysofpractice/).

I have always wanted to start a blog, but after many attempts, found that I couldn’t commit to writing regular posts and didn’t want to be held back by the “blog” form (what I consider to be a strict format of linear, fully written posts that are mostly unchanged after publishing).

A [[Digital Garden]] allows me to create interconnected pages and notes that are neither permanent nor need to be viewed chronologically.

Besides, it’s fun to think of myself as a gardener, cultivating and tending to my internet ‘garden’, with sprawling plots of various plant-notes.

I have a semi-green thumb in real life, so let’s hope that it transfers here! 🌱👍

# About the Garden

## Set-up
### Repository
The files can be found on Github [source](https://github.com/EyebrowHairs/eyebrowhairs.zettel.page), for anyone curious.

### Publishing
I use [Neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page/) to publish files to the web.

### Hosting
Github Pages

### File back-up
Dropbox

## Workflow
### Writing and editing
I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to write and edit files.

### Publishing
Then I open up Github Desktop Client to push/pull any changes to the repository.

Alternatively, I can directly edit files on the Github repository, or use [Cerveau](http://www.cerveau.app/), the web-interface for Neuron.
