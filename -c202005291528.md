## Getting serious about note-taking
- Started: 2020-07-07
- Type: academic
- I will be attending school in the Fall and want to have an optimal note-taking system set up and ready to go.
- Since my initial excitement over the [[202006172213]] <!-- Zettelkasten --> system fizzled, I haven’t been very serious about note-taking because I didn’t have any need to. I wasn’t keen on writing and didn’t have this blog either. My notes would usually be written on paper and notebooks, and occasionally digital files if I felt the need to. I also wrote a journal entry/life update once in a while. 
- Plans:
- [ ] Figure out an ideal way to incorporate Zotero (a reference manager) into my note-taking workflow. [This](https://forum.zettlr.com/discussion/94/zotero-as-zettelkasten) could fit.
- [ ] How to incorporate literature notes? Do I want them separated, but also summarized into a table?
- [ ] Reread Zettlr documentation…it’s been a while and I haven’t used it to its full capacity
- [ ] Explore other editor options? VS-Code has some promising extensions, but have to be combined and may not be compatible with each other. The key features I think I really need are: linking, referencing, and the ability to see file titles instead of filenames (I use numerical IDs as filenames because I’m prone to changing stuff). Everything else is a bonus. The last feature is pretty much what prevents me from using anything other than Zettlr. Also, I feel like I started my Zettelkasten journey when there weren’t many fancy options for implementing it (that I liked), so I am somewhat locked into this ‘do it manually’ mindset.
- [ ] Finish reading Grad School Essentials
- [ ] Practice reading and writing literature notes (with my neglected line-up of books/articles)
- [ ] How to streamline the process? I’m naturally lazy, and if something is too much work, then it will never get done. I need to make this as easy as possible to follow-through.
